<u>From a survivor:</u><br>We were kept as animals as children from the age of 3. We were tortured daily in a program of aceticism. <br>
<br>We were herded like animals, separated from our parents. <br>
<br>Our introduction to English was with lessons in self-sacrifice, fasting, acceptance of death, loss and pain, familicide and suicide. <br>
<br>The cult took our family property and taught us to face each day for the cause of death. <br>
<br>Every day we awoke from tortuous sleep, forbidden from having beds or pillows. We were then, every day, herded like animals, 3 years old, 4 years old, 5 years old, through the dark and cold to the bright lights of a shiny temple room to worship the images of a blue-black murder-rape demon called Krishna with his fantasy 108 fair-skinned women. There, without the touch of parents, like animals, forced to dance and perform for preachers and adults, with the images of bloody vicious familicidal murder; then indoctrinated with lectures on humility, sacrifice, karma and death, suicidal fasting, self-destruction, and self-blame, and worship of comfortable adults and statues of Indian men and statues of murderous animal men and the demon blue-black rape demon from India; instructed to seek death to be reincarnated as cows, grass, dirt, animals, and servants and slaves and sex partners with the blue-black fantasy demon from India and its representatives.
<br>
<br>
We who survived and escaped discovered the total robbery of our lives, the total and complete deception, the theft of our childhoods, the theft of our freedom to learn from our experience and thoughts. Our lives are haunted with the enduring memory of every day of the years of torture and indoctrination as todlers, and the lies and irrelavent Indian culture and hatred of our individuality and success. <br>
<br>This is what we experienced in the satanic Hare Krishna school for boys. They took everything: our family homes, our family money, our education, our family members, our futures, and our pasts. We were robbed, tortured, and sent to death, and in our homes and childhood properties we were replaced by thousands of Indian families, and Slavs and foreigners and the wealthy comfortable owners of the satanic Hare Krishna cult corporation (ISKCON Inc.), some of them our own parents, who robbed us of everything, within their power to steal and conceal, and they taught us to die and sent us to die.
